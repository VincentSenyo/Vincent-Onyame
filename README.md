# Natural Gas Price Analysis and Forecasting
**#Project Overview**
This project involves analyzing historical and current natural gas price data and forecasting future prices. The data represents the market price of natural gas delivered at the end of each calendar month, from October 31, 2020, to September 30, 2024. The goal is to provide an indicative price for longer-term storage contracts by extrapolating prices for an additional year beyond the available data
